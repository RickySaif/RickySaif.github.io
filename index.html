        Hi, my name is Ricky Saif! :)
    </p>
    <p>
        In daytime, I help teams who build the best Indonesia digital bank (<a href="https://jago.com/">Jago</a>) cultivate their innovation culture.
    </p>

    <p>
        At night, I wear my cloak, then educate Indonesians to routinely save gold & ₿itcoin. Why? Because it will:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Accelerate the limitation of money supply &mdash; consquently stopping one of the root causes of economic inequality. And
            </li>
            <li>
                Buy their long-term dreams sooner.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Born to a self-made street entrepreneur father, a well-read mother, and a lot of low-income relatives, I have plenty of empathy & curiosity toward humanity topics — which I'm more than happy to discuss.
    </p>
