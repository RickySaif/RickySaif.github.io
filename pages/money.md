title:  "Why Money Requires Energy?"

Because anyone with the power of creating money from zero (or very little) energy will be too powerful, up until it's impossible to believe that he/she (or his/her successors) won't be corrupt & harmful to society.

### Why Does It Matter to Discuss?

Because our legal money doesn't require an equivalent energy to create. The paper money ONLY cost 0.08% to 2.8% of its printed nominal (face value), [as the issuer said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm). The digital money? 0. Zero.

No wonder the money supply has been increasing exponentially since five decades ago, unlike [the flat increase of world's gross domestic product](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/).

It does matter to discuss it now. Why?

Because the harms to society has been slowly & steadily materialized for decades.

### The Proofs of Corruptness & Harmfulness

In Indonesia...

...also in USA (where it all begins).

### The Best Solution

Let me tell you two reasons why NOW is the time to end problems stated above.

First, 2023 is the time. The global trust to US Dollar as the main global currency & reserve finally declines. It's monumental, because US dollar was the only money pegged to gold -- a thing can't be created by any human -- for almost 3 decades (1944-1971). Here are the evidences:

* [Indonesia is one of the leaders of dedollarization initiative in ASEAN region](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/asean-finance-ministers-and-central-banks-consider-dropping-us-dollar-euro-and-yen-indonesia-calls-for-phasing-out-visa-and-mastercard/).
* [Saudi to finally break the petrodollar deal of 1974](https://www.dw.com/en/why-the-dollars-dominance-is-declining-in-the-middle-east/a-65662358).
* [Central banks just broke a record buying more gold](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/charted-30-years-of-central-bank-gold-demand/)

Secondly, in 2009, there was a birth of apolitical, limited-suply, & digital money which can only be created by spending energy not far from its market price -- just like gold. Fast forward 14 years to now, some institutional early adopters like Tesla & El Salvador had already hoarded Bitcoin -- seeing its potential as the future global money & reserve. US Securities and Exchange Commission has just declared Bitcoin as commodity -- not security -- which will invites more institutions to buy Bitcoin.

Unlike gold, Bitcoin validity is easy to verify & and cheap to transfer. Thus, it's more powerful as currency. It also solves the transparency problem of gold-as-reserve-currency, as anyone could see the current amount & the entire transaction history of any Bitcoin addresses.

That transparency problem was the cause of the 1971 dollar-gold depegging, which lead to other money to dollar depegging & banking deregulation, then ended up with increasing economic inequality, monetary destabilization of developing countries, and ongoing inflation. Ongoing inflation always hurts anyone who can't buy stocks or property -- the poors.

### What Should You Do

Do you research. Confirmed the validity of my data & opinions above. If you can't find the loophole, spend a little portion of your routine income to buy bitcoin (or gold). In this current unstable geopolitcal lanscape, it's very unlikely that you'll cut loss in the far future. This gold & bitcoin buying will accelerate the shift towards hard commodities (like bitcoin & gold) as the main reserve of central banks.

If you're not US citizen, your central bank will be more immune to US & world problems -- they REALLY care about this now. Also, it's easier for your fellow citizen to put presure on your central bank & government to not create much more money than the hard commodities they store. This will maintain this holy equation: money = energy.

Do not dream that bitcoin will be the only money & currency in this world. Not because it's impossible, but because the change is too dramatic to our current civilization system. Also, I found some drawbacks on that solution, but that's another story for another day.

### What Am I Doing Now?

I'm saving in bitcoin & gold. And spreading this idea to Indonesian -- my nation. To make it simpler & more inviting, I wrap it with the fifth principle of our nation (Pancasila):

> Social justice for every Indonesia citizen.

There's no social justice with widening income inequality. And I care.
