## Why?
Because anyone with the power of creating money from zero (or very little) energy will be too powerful, up until it's impossible to believe that he/she (or his/her successors) won't be corrupt & harmful to society.

## Why Does It Matter to Discuss?
Because our legal money doesn't require an equivalent energy to create. The paper money ONLY cost 0.1% to 3.1% of its face value, [as its maker said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm). The digital money? 0.

## Why Does It Matter to Discuss NOW?
Because the harms to society has been materialized for decades:

#### 1. Increasing Income Inequality
